# North Coding Team website
Alright fellas: we bought a domain name just to flex, now it's time to bring content to said domain name.
Not only is this an opportunity for you to learn how to use Git, it's also an opportunity for us to work as a team to make something neat. For example, look at chenjackson.com. I think that's a pretty neat site, even though it doesn't serve as a large function.


There's a lot we can do with website. We can make a webapp, e.g. an e-Block scheduler for North and South students. We could use the site to showcase our own prowess, kind of like a trophy display. Go nuts, and push whatever you want to the repo, just as long as it isn't malicious and doesn't break anything.
